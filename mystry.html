        The mystery genre is a genre of fiction that follows a crime (like a murder or a disappearance) from the moment
        it is committed to the moment it is solved. Mystery novels are often called “whodunnits” because they turn the
        reader into a detective trying to figure out the who, what, when, and how of a particular crime.
