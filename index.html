                Fiction:-<br>
                it is a mix of fictional and non fictional. Many, many things are true.<br> However, for the purpose of making money and selling books, JKR made up a<br> some things (such as the entire wizard stuff). Harry Potter is definitely a fiction<br> book because it talks about unrealistic things.

                The Little Prince.<br><br>
                The Little Prince is an honest and beautiful story about loneliness,<br> friendship, sadness, and love. The prince is a small boy <br>from a tiny planet (an asteroid to be precise), who travels the <br>universe, planet-to-planet, seeking <br>wisdom. On his journey, he discovers the unpredictable nature of adults.

                The narrator begins with a discussion on the nature of grown-ups <br>and their inability to perceive "important things". As a test to<br> determine if a grown-up is as enlightened as a child, he shows them a <br>picture depicting a boa constrictor which has eaten an <br>elephant. The grown-ups always reply that the picture depicts<br> a hat, and so he knows to only talk of "reasonable" things to them,<br> rather than the fanciful.
